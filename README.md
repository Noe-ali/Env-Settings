Welcome to the Windows Terminal Profile and Settings Repository! This repository houses configuration files for my personal picks on Windows Terminal, Desktop and other stuff. This repository will still include other configurations on my PC, allowing you to easily personalize your terminal environment and make it more efficient and visually appealing.
## Getting Started
To use my configurations you will need the following stuff installed on your system (Currently Running Windows 11 22H2)
- Windows Powershell
- [OhMyPosh](https://ohmyposh.dev/)
- [Komorebi WM](https://github.com/LGUG2Z/komorebi)
- [Droptop four](https://www.droptopfour.com/)

## Repository Structure
```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1
â”œâ”€â”€ terminal-settings.json
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

## Usage
1. The `Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1` file contains individual profile settings files, each corresponding to a specific terminal profile (PowerShell), in this case it includes the aliases to start the Komorebi WM. To use it just open your $PROFILE file by typing ```notepad $PROFILE``` on your terminal and replace all the content with the Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1 content file.

2. The file terminal-settings.json is the main Windows Terminal configuration file that includes all the profiles and global settings. To use it just open your settings.json file by typing ```ctrl``` + ```Shift``` + ```,``` on your terminal and replace all the content with the terminal-settings.json content file.

To update your ohmyposh theme, just open your $PROFILE file with notepad or any other editor and pase the configuration inside.

To initialize Komorebi, just use the command ```komorebic-start```


Use version control (e.g., Git) to track changes and collaborate with others on your terminal setup.

Customization
Feel free to customize various aspects of your terminal environment:
You can add more themes to the "schemes" section of the settings-json, notice that to change the background, you'll need to remove the "backgroundImage" pointing to my OneDrive images for your own.
